![](https://github.com/forestcv/One-Shot-Template-Detector-based-on-Keypoints/blob/master/example/example.gif)

One-Shot template detector based on SIFT features and FGINN keypoints matching strategy

## Features
1. C++ implementation of [FGINN matching strategy](https://github.com/ducha-aiki/matching-strategies-comparison)
2. Opportunaty to choose between SIFT + FGINN and ORB + KNN strategies

## TO DO
1. Add different frame sources (sequences of images, webcameras)
2. Add GPU versions of one-shot detector
